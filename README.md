# Projects
Hi there, I'm Naman! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm a junior undergrad who's completely fascinated by applying AI in high impact domains where data-driven solutions can make a real difference. This repo is my journey of getting my hands dirty with computer vision, NLP, and privacy-preserving machine learning.

Here, I've tried to tackle some interesting challenges from start to finish. I've built Ensemble Models to better classify diabetic retinopathy, dug into Federated Learning to see how we can respect patient privacy while training models for tumor segmentation, and even built a pipeline to generate medical reports from X-rays, which started with a fascinating NLP puzzle - Language!

Every project has a story. You'll find them in the detailed READMEs inside each folder. Thanks for stopping by!
